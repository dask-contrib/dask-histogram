The [boost-histogram](https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram)
library provides a performant object oriented API for histogramming in
Python. Building on the foundation of boost-histogram, dask-histogram
adds support for lazy calculations on Dask collections.

**The library is still in development but welcomes testing.**
